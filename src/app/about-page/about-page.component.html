      A modern news management system built with Angular and PHP microservices, featuring user authentication, role-based access control, and a responsive UI. Users can post and manage news content through an intuitive interface, while administrators have full CRUD capabilities for both users and news entries via a dedicated dashboard.

      The main purpose is to allow users to post and manage news content with different levels of access -
      regular users can post news and manage their profiles, guests can preview the site and admins have full
      control over users and news content.</p>
